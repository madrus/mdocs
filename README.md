# Notes on Madrus's Docs

In this documentation, I am collecting tips and tricks that at some point proved to be useful. I am doing it "along the way": every time I get stuck and later later find the solution. Therefore, it is never complete and finished. **It is always work in progress**.

On the **About** page, you can find more details about installation and styling of the website.

Website can be seen at [https://madrus.github.io/mdocs/](https://madrus.github.io/mdocs/).
