# Go Notes

## Go Tools

### Local Go Documentation

The Go documentation is also available in a browsable format. This gives you `godoc` documentation as a local web server. To start your own documentation server, type:

``` bash
godoc -http=:6060
```

This command instructs `godoc` to start a web server on local port `6060`. If you open your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:6060>, you’ll see a web page with documentation for both the Go standard libraries and any Go source that lives in your `GOPATH`.

The best part of Go’s documentation tool is that it works for your code, too. If you follow simple conventions while writing your code, it will automatically include your comments in the Go documentation generated by `godoc`. To be included in the godoc generated documentation, your code needs to be documented by adding comments that follow a specific convention. Start by adding comments directly above the identifiers you want to document. This works for packages, functions, types, and global variables. Comments can be started using either two slashes, or using the slash-asterisk style.

``` go
// Retrieve connects to the configuration repository and gathers
// various connection settings, usernames, passwords. It returns a
// config struct on success, or an error.
func Retrieve() (config, error) {
// ... omitted
}
```

If you want to add a large body of text to document your package, include a file called `doc.go` that declares the same package as your project, and put your package introduction as a comment before the package declaration:

``` go
/*
  Package usb provides types and functions for working with USB
  devices. To connect to a USB device start by creating a new USB
  connection with NewConnection
  ...
*/
package usb
```

This package documentation will be shown before any type or function documentation is displayed for your package. It also demonstrates using the slash-asterisk type of comment. You can read more about creating good documentation for your code by searching for _golang documentation_ in Google.
