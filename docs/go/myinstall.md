# Installation Notes

## MAC OS X

On my MAC OS X, I ended up installing and using `Go` from the official `.dmg` package from the [Go website](https://golang.org/).

!!! ERROR "Installation Issues"

    I have had bad experience when trying to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm). Probably because I tried to install new installation option without properly cleaning everything from the previous one.

The following files may have "traces" of different settings:

- `~/.bash_profile`
- `~/.bashrc`
- `~/.profile`
