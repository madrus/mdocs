## About this documentation

### WTF?

You may ask yourself a question: "What's the point of having a __Markdown__ documentation website if there are tools like [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) or [Microsoft Sharepoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration)?" Indeed, what?

### BEFORE: Confluence and Sharepoint

`Confluence` and `Sharepoint` are good portals for project documentation, and are very useful for managers, information analysts, architects, etc. For all sorts of reference information. They also allow the whole team and even organisation to work on the same documents in an easy way. However, in my mind these tools have certain downsizes specifically for us software developers. We need to have our own hub of documentation where program code looks like code with all the syntax color marking to make it more readable and understandable. We need efficient access to __how-to__ type of documentation containing searchable how-to guides, walk-through procedures, hints and tips on specific techniques, languages and projects.

It is well-known that searching on Confluence or Sharepoint is a huge headache. One gets presented with pages upon pages of links that for 95% are irrelevant to what you are looking for. These company portals are "overcrowded". :innocent:

### Markdown

__[Markdown](engine/cheatsheet.md)__ is a much more suitable language for developers' documentation. You write plain text and you get beautiful website automatically generated. So, one does not even need to have Microsoft Office installed. Any plain text editor will do. You can even use emoji. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Isn't the website you are currently looking at amazingly beautiful?! And it consists for 100% out Markdown documents. It is more like a __blog__ for yourself and your teammates.

Also, for developers it is very handy to create __Markdown__ `README.md` files in every project and/or solution. This is what the whole __open-source world__ has been already doing for many years. Every __GitHub__ repository contains a standard `README.md` file as its home page. Even __Microsoft__ keeps a lot of its own documentation as `Markdown` documents in GitHub! See e.g. [Windows PowerShell documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/tree/master/docset/windows). In [Azure DevOps/Visual Studio Online/VSTS](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vso/), every repository also has a standard Markdown home page.

Collecting tips and tricks can be huge fun. Just do it along the way every time you get stuck and later find the solution. Then every bit of information will be useful to you and other developers.

Enjoy! :wink:
