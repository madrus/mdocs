# Git Command Line Tools

### ConEmu

#### Show Branch Name on Command Line

Run `GitShowBranch /i` to install showing branch, `GitShowBranch /u` to uninstall.

Also, you may run your `cmd` as following (within Task contents or ConEmu's Command line)

```bash
cmd /k ver & GitShowBranch /i
```

Unfortunately, I could not yet get this last setting to work with my __ConEmu__.
